# MatlabSiemensInfo
Matlab function to parse proprietary Siemens DICOM field from new VA platforms

Adapted from the great Dirk-Jan Kroon original function, found here:
https://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27941-dicom-toolbox

Note, it currently does NOT parse the first part that is a XML structure. 
Any feedback or suggestion for improvement welcome.
